drivingDirection.github.io
==========================

For next version, I am targeting following features.

    Generate list on left hand side panel dynamically based on users preference. Either we can fetch data from XML or through database. Right now it contains static information.
    Show pin points for all related doctors on map. User can directly click on them to get route.
    Once user gets driving direction on map. Show him a pop-up or sidebar widget showing information regarding booking information.
    Show profile information of selected person on left hand side panel. It will contain information like Name, short intro, occupation, credentials, rating.
